## 📁 Versioning Policy

CoreX follows a **stable core / modular release** strategy:

- Major version = core API or OS architectural shift
- Minor version = new features or expanded platform support
- Patch = security, performance, or dependency updates

All versions are **internally certified** and tested in **staging clusters** before partner deployment.
